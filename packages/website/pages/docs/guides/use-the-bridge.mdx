# Use the bridge

<Callout type="warning">
  The BLL token is **expected to fail** about 50% of the time when bridging--this is done intentionally to test error handling.
</Callout>

## Overview

This guide will help you use the bridge to send tokens between Sepolia and WYzth_zkevm (Alpha-3 testnet). You can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/concepts/bridging).

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Sepolia and/or WYzth_zkevm (you can [receive tokens here](/docs/guides/receive-tokens)).

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit the bridge
    Visit the [bridge](https://bridge.test.wyzth_zkevm.xyz/) and the UI should be intuitive.

    ### Bridge tokens from Sepolia to WYzth_zkevm
    Try bridging ETH, HORSE, and/or BLL from Sepolia to WYzth_zkevm. You can also try manually claiming the transfer yourself by clicking the "Claim" button under the "Transactions" tab.
